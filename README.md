# Verify-Pro-A Framework for Server Authentication using Communication Protocol Dialects


In this paper, we develop a novel system, called Verify-Pro, toprovide server authentication using communication protocol dialects â€“ that uses a client-server architecture based on networkprotocols for customizing the communication transactions. Foreach session, a particular sequence of handshakes will be used as dialects. So, given the context, with the establishment of one time username and password, we use the dialects as an authentication mechanism for each request (e.g.,get filenamein FTP) throughout the session which enforces continuous authentication. Specifically, we leverage a machine learning approach (pre-trained neural network model) on both client and server machines to communicate in a specific dialect dynamically for each request.


## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies for system

* Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
* Memory 1.9GiB
* Pocessor- Intel CoreTM i7-4600M CPU @ 2.90GHz
* OS type: 64 bit
* Linux

### Dependencies for Neural network model

### Libraries for for FTP server

### Installing

* VM image of Verify-Pro tool can be found here: 

### Executing program
```
On server side: sudo python3 server.py 21 
On client side: sudo python3 client.py 127.0.0.1 21

127.0.0.1 -> Hostname (can be changed)
21 -> port number (can be changed)
```

## Help: 
* FTP server login details can be found in users.txt file
```
FTP server login details can be found in users.txt file 
Users who want to try different filenames, can give this input: (get-> command, file.txt is a filename for FTP protocol)
D1  - get file.txt
D4  - get karthikeya.txt 
D8  - get gwu.txt 
D9  - get george.txt 
D10 - get dummy.txt
```

## Note:
* Please refer the paper for the customized transactions of the communication protocol.
* Neural network & decision tree model: check in the output folder

## Programming language Version 

* Python3
